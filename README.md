## To build a quadratic equation solver that solves x in the format ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d initializing a, b, c, and d to an integer, with the help of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and the Rectified Linear Function (ReLU).
### To the reviewer : in kaggle ,while saving the notebook ,it cant take any input  bcoz of some enviormental problem.so in the file of the repo it can't  see the input
